// REACT //

// Section 1: Getting Started

// Lesson #2 What is React.js?

// What?
// A javascript library for building user-interfaces.

// Why?
// React fetches data based on event listeners triggered by user interactions, behind the scenes in the background without reloading or leaving the page, and then updates what is seen on the screen with the fetched data, leading to a smooth transition between pages and state changes(updates to displayed data).

// Why Not Just Use JS?
// Because working with just JavaScript is cumbersome. It means more work for you. It can be more error prone. Especially, if you're building more complex user interfaces, and more complex applications like a Netflix web app, for example, then using just vanilla JavaScript, without any library like React, would just be a huge pain and wouldn't be a very realistic option.
//      Additionally, JS becomes hard to maintain and edit. And, React offers a simple "mental model", especially for complex projects.

// Lesson #3 ReactJS vs "Vanilla JavaScript": Why Use React?

// Code examples:
// React: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-udemy-demo-simple-react-app-2645v4
// JS: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-udemy-demo-simple-js-app-vzw646?file=/index.js

// With React, you define the target UI state(s) - not the steps to get there. Instead, React will figure out and perform the necessary steps.
//      - With React, there is less code that needs to be written, and React takes care of updating the UI. React uses JavaScript under the hood to update the UI, and we instead just define our conditions(goals), our target states, and when these states should change, and React will take care of the rest.

// Declarative vs. Imperative Paradigms:

// React = declarative -> Define the goal, not the steps.
// JS = imperative -> Define the steps, not the goal.

// Course Content: https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-code

// Lesson #10 Creating React Projects Locally

// Create a keyboard shortcut for the "Format Document" command to make it easier to format/cleanup code.

// To create a new react app run: npx create-react-app <app-name>
// To create a new react app run: npm create vite@latest <app-name>

// Lesson #11 Using CodeSandbox For React Development (No Local Setup Required!)

// To create a new react app in the browser type: react.new
// To adjust CodeSandbox settings: click on the menu icon -> File -> Preferences -> Settings or CodeSandbox Settings.
